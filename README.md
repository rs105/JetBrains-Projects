A few of the projects that I've worked on with Python

1. Hangman : The basic game of hangman which provides the user with a few choices to guess the hidden word. If the user guesses it correctly within the given number of tries, he/she wins the game. Else they lose.

2. Credit Calculator : Finance is an important part of the life of any people. Sometimes we think about getting additional income and want to open a deposit account. And sometimes we need additional money right now and want to take a credit or mortgage. Anyway, we may want to calculate different financial indicators to make a decision. So this is such an instrument that can help us.
